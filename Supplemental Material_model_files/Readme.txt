For further exploration
	*The "Plots" folder within each model run contains all model plots for data, model fits and model outputs.
	*The inputs and outputs of each folder are easy retrieved using the r4ss library and the function SS_output(). Outputs can also be explored in the "Report" file within each folder.


Labels for each folder are as follows:
	*M_fur denotes the species name
	*_estM are models that estimate natural mortality
	*_rec are models that estimate recruitment deviations
	*_logsel are models that assume logistic selectivity for the trawl fleets
